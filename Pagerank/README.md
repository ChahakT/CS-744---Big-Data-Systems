Here, I have the code and report for Assignment 1 in CS 744. We implemented pagerank algorithm using RDDs and DataFrames in Spark. We installed hadoop and spark on the cluster nodes provided to us CloudLab Wisconsin datacentre.

The PageRank and Sorting applications assume the following:
1. Spark is installed and the environment variables are correctly set
2. Hadoop is installed and the environment variables are correct
